# MOMENTVM Lazy Loading

MOMENTVM lazy loading is an optional help for lazy loading using the blur-up technique. For more information go to docs.momentvm.com

We use the blur up from https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes with the blur up plugin https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes/tree/master/plugins/blur-up

To demo, start the local http server by typing

```js
npm start serve
```
